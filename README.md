# Flywheel-rowing-machine
In my 4th semester of mechatronics engineering, I participated in a project together with my college's football coach to create rowing machines for athletes who needed rehabilitation.

In this project, I was in charge of the designing part, which involved carrying out an analysis of forces and efforts in each of the elements of our rowing machine. Also, I had to investigate the types of resistances that are in the current market for this kind of machine, and together with my team, we decided to go for a more innovative idea, which is to use an inertial disk to obtain the necessary resistance for the rower to work. Likewise, a compact and retractable design was sought to make it easy to store.
